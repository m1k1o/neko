# Changelog

## master branch

### Bugs
- Fixed fullscreen incompatibility for Safari [#121](https://github.com/m1k1o/neko/issues/121).
- Fixed bad emoji matching for e.g. `:+1:` and `:100:` with new regex `/^:([^:\s]+):/`.

### New Features
- Added `m1k1o/neko:microsoft-edge` tag.
- Fixed clipboard sync in chromium based browsers.
- Added support for implicit control (using `NEKO_IMPLICITCONTROL=1`). That means, users do not need to request control prior usage.
- Automatically start broadcasting using `NEKO_BROADCAST_URL=rtmp://your-rtmp-endpoint/live` (thanks @konsti).
- Added `m1k1o/neko:remmina` tag (by @lowne).

### Misc
- Automatic WebRTC SDP negotiation using onnegotiationneeded handlers. This allows adding/removing track on demand in a session.
- Added UDP and TCP mux for WebRTC connection. It should handle multiple peers.
- Broadcast status change is sent to all admins now.
- NordVPN replaced with Sponsorblock extension in default configuration #144.
- Removed `vncviewer` image, as its functionality is replaced and extended by remmina.
