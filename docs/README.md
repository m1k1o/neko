# n.eko

This app uses Web RTC to stream a desktop inside of a docker container, original author made this because [rabb.it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabb.it) went under and his internet could not handle streaming and discord kept crashing when his friend attempted to. He just wanted to watch anime with his friends ·Éö(‡≤†Áõä‡≤†·Éö) so he started digging throughout the internet and found a few *kinda* clones, but none of them had the virtual browser, then he found [Turtus](https://github.com/Khauri/Turtus) and he was able to figure out the rest.

Then I found [this](https://github.com/nurdism/neko) project and started to dig into it. I really liked the idea of having collaborative browser browsing together with mutliple people, so I created a fork. Initially, I wanted to merge my changes to the upstream repository, but the original author did not have time for this project anymore and it got eventually archived.

### Features

  * Text Chat (With basic markdown support, discord flavor)
  * Admin users (Kick, Ban & Force Give/Release Controls)
  * Clipboard synchronization (on [supported browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard/readText))
  * Emote overlay
  * Ignore user (chat and emotes)
  * Persistent settings

### Why n.eko?

I like cats üê± (`Neko` is the Japanese word for cat), I'm a weeb/nerd.

***But why the cat butt?*** Because cats are *assholes*, but you love them anyways.
