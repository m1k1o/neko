# n.eko

Welcome to Neko, a self-hosted virtual browser that runs in Docker and uses WebRTC technology. Neko is a powerful tool that allows you to **run a fully-functional browser in a virtual environment**, giving you the ability to **access the internet securely and privately from anywhere**. With Neko, you can browse the web, **run applications**, and perform other tasks just as you would on a regular browser, all within a **secure and isolated environment**. Whether you are a developer looking to test web applications, a **privacy-conscious user seeking a secure browsing experience**, or simply someone who wants to take advantage of the **convenience and flexibility of a virtual browser**, Neko is the perfect solution.

In addition to its security and privacy features, Neko offers the **ability for multiple users to access it simultaneously**. This makes it an ideal solution for teams or organizations that need to share access to a browser, as well as for individuals who want to use **multiple devices to access the same virtual environment**. With Neko, you can **easily and securely share access to a browser with others**, without having to worry about maintaining separate configurations or settings. Whether you need to **collaborate on a project**, access shared resources, or simply want to **share access to a browser with friends or family**, Neko makes it easy to do so.

Neko is also a great tool for **hosting watch parties** and interactive presentations. With its virtual browser capabilities, Neko allows you to host watch parties and presentations that are **accessible from anywhere**, without the need for in-person gatherings. This makes it easy to **stay connected with friends and colleagues**, even when you are unable to meet in person. With Neko, you can easily host a watch party or give an **interactive presentation**, whether it's for leisure or work. Simply invite your guests to join the virtual environment, and you can share the screen and **interact with them in real-time**.

## About

This app uses WebRTC to stream a desktop inside a docker container, original author made this because [rabb.it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabb.it) went under, and his internet could not handle streaming and discord kept crashing when his friend attempted to. He just wanted to watch anime with his friends ·Éö(‡≤†Áõä‡≤†·Éö) so he started digging throughout the internet and found a few *kinda* clones, but none of them had the virtual browser, then he found [Turtus](https://github.com/Khauri/Turtus), and he was able to figure out the rest.

Then I found [this](https://github.com/nurdism/neko) project and started to dig into it. I really liked the idea of having collaborative browser browsing together with multiple people, so I created a fork. Initially, I wanted to merge my changes to the upstream repository, but the original author did not have time for this project anymore, and it got eventually archived.

### Why n.eko?

I like cats üê± (`Neko` is the Japanese word for cat), I'm a weeb/nerd.

***But why the cat butt?*** Because cats are *assholes*, but you love them anyway.
