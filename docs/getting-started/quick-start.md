# Quick Start

1. Deploy a server or VPS.

    **Recommended Specs:**
    
    | Resolution  | Cores | Ram   | Recommendation   |
    |-------------|-------|-------|------------------|
    | 1024Ã—576@30 | 2     | 2gb   | Not Recommended  |
    | 1280x720@30 | 4     | 3gb   | Good Performance |
    | 1280x720@30 | 6     | 4gb   | Recommended      |
    | 1280x720@30 | 8     | 4gb+  | Best Performance |
  
    *Why are the specs so high?* : If you think about it, you have to run a full desktop, a browser (a resource hog on its own) *and* encode/transmit the desktop, there's a lot going on and so it demands some power.

    *Note:* Admin can change the resolution in the GUI.

2. [Login via SSH](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/connect-with-ssh/).

3. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/):
    ```shell
    curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | CHANNEL=stable bash
    ```

4. Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/):
    ```shell
    sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    ```

5. Download docker compose file and start it:
    ```shell
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m1k1o/neko/master/docker-compose.yaml
    sudo docker-compose up -d
    ```

6. Visit the IP address server in your browser and login, the default password is `neko`.

> ðŸ’¡ **Protip**: Run `nano docker-compose.yaml` to edit the settings, then press `ctrl+x` to exit and save the file.
